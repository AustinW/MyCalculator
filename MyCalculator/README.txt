# My Calculator

## Bugs
1. If the user enters an operator multiple times in a row without entering a digit, the calculator will not work properly
2. The display does not update between operations, only when pressing the "=" button.

## Features
1. Uses an infix shunting yard algorithm to convert infix to postfix notation (useful for calculators which enable a user to enter a string of input)

## Implemented
All specific requirements implemented
